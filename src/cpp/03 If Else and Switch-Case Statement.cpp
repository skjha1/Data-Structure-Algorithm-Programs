/* Control Structures in C++
The work of control structures is to give flow and logic to a program. There are three types of basic control structures in C++.

Sequence Structure
Sequence structure refers to the sequence in which program execute instructions one after another.  

Selection Structure
Selection structure refers to the execution of instruction according to the selected 
condition, which can be either true or false. There are two ways to implement 
selection structures, by “if-else statements” or by “switch case statements”.

Loop Structure
Loop structure refers to the execution of an instruction in a loop until the condition gets false.
